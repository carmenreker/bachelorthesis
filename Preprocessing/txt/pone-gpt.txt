The "My World Survey-Second Level" (MWS-SL) targeted mental health risk and protective factors in adolescents aged 12-19 across Ireland, recruiting from 10% of the 732 second-level schools, achieving a final sample of 6,062 students from 72 schools, with a school response rate of 42%. Data collection occurred during school hours from February to October 2011, with ethical approval from the University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee and required consents obtained.

Participants self-reported on risk and protective factors across individual, family, peer, school, and social environment domains, plus a 'Polysubstance' domain to account for general substance use variability. Outcomes focused on substance use, assessing lifetime and recent alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use. Specifically, alcohol use was gauged using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and risky use thresholds were defined for each substance.

The study employed logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization, imposing both L1 and L2 penalties to manage correlated variables and feature scaling. The cross-validation process divided data into ten groups, refining models across 30 alpha and lambda settings. Model effectiveness was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and F1 scores.

Data exclusions were made based on incomplete responses or missing data on key variables, with multiple imputation performed on the remaining data. The final analysis included 5,680 participants. Differences in age, sex, and ethnicity between the excluded and included samples were statistically significant but not deemed substantial enough to introduce bias.
