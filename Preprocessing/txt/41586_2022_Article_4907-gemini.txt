Ethics and Registration:

    All studies were approved by Institutional Review Boards and participants provided informed consent.
    All studies are registered on the Open Science Framework ([OSF link will be provided later]).
    Detailed descriptions of materials, analyses, and deviations from plans are available in the Supplementary Information.
    Studies 1, 2, and 4 were pre-registered before data analysis. Studies 3, 5, and 6 were pre-registered after data analysis, but followed rigorous standards to constrain researcher bias.

Intervention:

    The intervention was a 30-minute online self-administered session.
    Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group.
    Both conditions were blinded (participants and researchers did not know which group they were in).

Synergistic Mindsets Intervention:

    This intervention aimed to change negative mindsets about stressful events.
    It targeted two mindsets:
        Fixed mindset: the belief that intelligence is fixed and cannot change.
        Stress-is-debilitating mindset: the belief that stress is negative and harms performance, health, and well-being.
    The intervention countered these negative mindsets with:
        Growth mindset: the belief that intelligence can develop through effort.
        Stress-can-be-enhancing mindset: the belief that stress can be helpful for performance, health, and well-being.
    Participants were encouraged to see challenges as opportunities for growth and view stress as the body's natural way to help them overcome challenges.
    The intervention used educational materials, stories from successful students, and writing exercises to reinforce these messages.
    Adherence to the intervention was high (above 82%) across all studies.

Control Group Content:

    The control group also received a 30-minute online self-administered session.
    The content looked similar to the intervention but did not target mindsets.
    It included information about the brain, memory, and the body's stress response system.

Baseline Measures:

    Participants completed questionnaires to assess negative mindsets at the beginning of each study (except study 2).

Analysis Strategy:

    The researchers used a statistical method called Bayesian causal forests (BCF) to analyze the data.
    This method is designed to be conservative and avoid misleading results.
    The researchers focused on estimating the size of the treatment effect (how much the intervention helped) rather than null hypothesis testing (finding statistically significant results).
    Covariates (factors that could influence the results) were included in the analysis to account for any imbalances between the groups.

Sample Size and Participants:

    Study 1 aimed for a large, diverse sample (3,000 adolescents) but achieved a final sample size of 2,503 due to pandemic limitations. Participants were recruited from public schools (grades 8-12) and represented a mix of genders, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
    Study 2 included introductory social science college students (N=83) who were predominantly female and came from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds.

Procedure:

    Study 1 used an online platform where participants imagined a stressful assignment and reported their appraisals before and after the intervention. They also chose between an easy or challenging assignment at the end.
    Study 2 involved students completing the intervention or control materials before a graded quiz and then reporting their appraisals of the quiz.

Measures:

    Study 1 assessed event-focused appraisals (threat to performance) and response-focused appraisals (body's stress response as helpful or hurtful). It also measured behavioral intentions by recording choices between easy and hard assignments.
    Study 2 used self-reported agreement with statements about whether their body's stress responses helped or hurt their quiz performance.

Key Findings:

    Study 1 showed the intervention increased the likelihood of choosing the challenging assignment.
    Study 2 did not report the main results yet, but will describe how the intervention impacted students' appraisals of their stress responses during a quiz.

Overall:

These studies aimed to test the feasibility and initial effectiveness of the intervention in different educational settings (high school vs. college) and with diverse populations.

Study 5: Daily Stress Responses in Adolescents

    Participants:
        118 adolescents from a low-income urban charter school (99% from economically disadvantaged families)
        78% Black/African American, 5% White or Asian
        Grades 9-12
    Procedure:
        Participants were assigned to one of three groups: intervention, control, or baseline measure.
        Intervention group received the synergistic mindsets intervention on a tablet.
        All groups completed daily diary entries (twice a day) for five consecutive school days, reporting on stressors and their feelings about themselves that day.
        Saliva samples were also collected three times a day to measure cortisol levels (a stress hormone).
    Key Findings:
        The study aimed to assess the intervention's impact on daily negative self-regard (feelings about oneself) and cortisol levels.
        Results are not explicitly mentioned but will likely be presented in a future publication.

Study 6: Anxiety During COVID-19 Lockdowns

    Participants:
        Undergraduate social science students from the same university as Study 2.
    Procedure:
        Participants received the intervention in January 2020.
        In April 2020 (during COVID-19 lockdowns), they completed a survey measuring general anxiety symptoms.
    Key Findings:
        The intervention group showed reduced general anxiety symptoms compared to the control group.

Overall:

    These studies aimed to examine the effectiveness of the intervention on stress and anxiety in real-world settings (daily life and a pandemic situation).
    Study 5 focused on daily experiences of adolescents, while Study 6 investigated the impact on anxiety during a stressful event (lockdowns).
