## Summary of Infant Peer Emotion Response Study Method

This summary outlines the methods used in a study investigating how infants respond to a peer's emotions towards toys.

**Participants**

* 23 12-month-olds (8 male)
* 24 18-month-olds (11 male)
* 21 24-month-olds (9 male)
* All typically developing from a middle-class background
* Data excludes one 12-month-old who didn't touch the toys

**Procedure**

* Infants participated in a short warm-up period followed by testing in a separate room.
* They viewed pre-recorded videos of a child displaying emotions towards toys on a monitor.
* While seated in a high chair, infants watched three 50-second trials.
* Each trial consisted of:
    * 5-second intro video to focus attention
    * 20-second video of a peer displaying an emotion (neutral, positive, or negative) towards one of two novel toys
    * 30-second play period with both toys within reach
* A curtain obscured the experimenter who moved the toys into reach after each trial.
* Parents sat beside the child but were instructed not to interact. 
* A camera recorded the child's behavior throughout.

**Stimuli and Materials**

* Four novel toys were presented in pairs.
* Videos showed a 6-year-old girl displaying neutral, positive, or fearful expressions towards one toy in each pair.
* The girl used facial expressions, vocalizations, and toy descriptions to convey emotions.
* In the first trial, all children saw the peer display neutral interest towards a toy.
* In the second trial, half saw positive emotion (happiness) and half saw negative emotion (fear) directed towards one toy (target).
* The other toy (distracter) received no attention from the peer.
* Toy pairings and target toy location were counterbalanced across trials.

**Measures**

* Trained coders, blind to the condition, analyzed video recordings with sound muted.
* Two main behaviors were coded:
    * Looking time at the video display during each presentation (measured in seconds).
    * Touch time of each toy during the play period (measured in seconds, including any holding, playing, or touching).
* Reliability was ensured by having multiple coders analyze a subset of videos (high agreement between coders).
* To account for variation in how quickly parents removed toys, only the first 30 seconds of play time were coded for each trial.
