The method section of the clinical trial in psychology describes the procedure and measures used to study emotional referencing in infants of varying ages. Participants consisted of 68 infants categorized into three age groups: 23 twelve-month-olds, 24 eighteen-month-olds, and 21 twenty-four-month-olds. These infants were healthy, typically developing, and primarily from Caucasian middle-class backgrounds. The testing excluded data from one 12-month-old due to non-interaction with toys.

The procedure began with a warm-up period to acclimate infants to the lab, followed by a testing phase in a separate room. The testing setup included a 44 cm TV monitor displaying pre-recorded video clips of a 6-year-old girl expressing emotions towards toys. Infants were seated in a high chair with their mothers positioned to their left, who filled out questionnaires without interacting with their children. Each session included three trials where toys were initially placed out of reach but moved within reach after the video display. The emotional display varied per trial, with the first showing neutral emotions, the second displaying either positive or negative emotions, and the third consistently showing positive emotions. The toys involved included a spiral letter holder, a rubber jack, a hose adapter, and a plastic tube with a red wing nut.

Stimuli for the trials were constructed with the same young girl expressing directed emotions towards toys, which varied per trial between being the target of emotional expression or a distracter. Her expressions were standardized in intensity and accompanied by verbal descriptions.

For data collection, video recordings focused solely on the infants' faces were analyzed for the total duration of their attention to the video display and interaction with the toys. Coding was performed using the Noldusâ„¢ Observer 5.0 software, with measures of looking and touching time evaluated for consistency across sessions. A subset of the recordings was reassessed to ensure reliability in coding outcomes.

This detailed methodology ensures replicability by providing precise participant demographics, procedural settings, stimuli details, and measures of behavioral responses.
