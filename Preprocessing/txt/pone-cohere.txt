The My World Survey-Second Level (MWS-SL) is a cross-sectional study that collected data from a representative sample of Irish adolescents aged 12-19 years. The study aimed to investigate risk and protective factors for mental health. Out of 171 randomly selected schools, 72 participated, yielding a sample of 6,062 students (51% female) with a response rate of 42%. Data were collected through self-report measures and single-item indicators, assessing domains like individual, family, peer, school, social environment, and polysubstance. The study protocol was ethically approved, and informed consent was obtained from participants and their parents/guardians. 

The dependent variables focused on lifetime and risky use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis. Independent variables included various factors from the clustered domains. Machine learning procedures involved logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization, feature scaling, and cross-validation techniques. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AROC) and the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1 score). Data processing involved deleting observations with missing data and multiple imputations, with a final analytic sample of 5,680 students. The study followed standard procedures for survey administration in schools and obtained ethical approval.
