Method:

Participant Recruitment and Characteristics:
- Parent-adolescent pairs (dyads) were recruited from a juvenile drug court (JDC) diversion program in the northeastern US, totaling 47 families included in the study out of 283 referred. 
- Adolescents had active substance use but varied in terms of criminal charges.
- The study interventions were assigned randomly to the dyads: Family-Based Affect Management Intervention (FAMI) or adolescent-only Health Promotion Intervention (HPI).

Interventions:
- FAMI aimed to prevent substance use and HIV by improving emotion regulation and motivation in adolescents and building parental support skills over four primary sessions and one "booster" session.
- HPI provided psychoeducation on substance use, HIV prevention, and health-related topics and was matched to FAMI in terms of time and appeal.

Measures and Data Collection:
- Measures were taken at baseline and 3 months post-intervention using Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI).
- Parent distress was assessed using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), specifically the Global Severity Index (GSI) as an indicator of overall psychological distress.
- Adolescent substance use and sexual risk behaviors were evaluated using the Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA), focusing on marijuana and alcohol use days and unprotected sexual acts.
- Adolescent mental health was assessed through the Youth Self-Report (YSR), analyzing internalizing and externalizing problem scales.

Data Analysis:
- Analyzed outcomes at post-intervention, considering intervention condition, baseline parent distress, and their interaction, with baseline levels of outcomes as covariates.
- Modeled dichotomous and count variables for substance use and RSB outcomes and used logistic regression and generalized linear models, respectively.
- Utilized linear regression for mental health outcomes.
- Employed the Johnson-Neyman technique to probe significant interactions and identify the region of significance.
- Handled missing data by imputing baseline values and excluding incomplete assessments.
