## Summary of Study Methods in the My World Survey (MWS-SL)

This summary details the methods used in the My World Survey (MWS-SL), a cross-sectional study that examined risk and protective factors for mental health in adolescents.

**Participants:**

* 6,062 adolescents aged 12-19 years from 72 randomly selected schools in Ireland.
* Data collection occurred between February and October 2011 with informed consent from participants and guardians.

**Measures:**

* Self-report questionnaires assessed risk and protective factors categorized into domains like Family, Peer, and School.
* Alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use were measured to account for potential substance use influences.

**Machine Learning Analysis:**

* Logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization was used to identify the most relevant factors associated with alcohol use (never vs. ever or risky use).
* Model performance was assessed using AROC (accuracy) and F1 score (precision and recall balance).

**Data Processing:**

* Incomplete surveys and data missing on key variables were excluded.
* Multiple imputation addressed remaining missing data points.
* Compared to the full sample, the final analysis group had a slightly higher average age and differed in gender and ethnicity composition.

**Further details on specific measures and procedures are available in a separate file (S1 File).**
