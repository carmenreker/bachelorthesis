Here is a summary of the method section of the clinical trial:

This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Zanjan, Iran, from October 2020 to May 2021, enrolling pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. The participants were selected from 10 randomly chosen health centers out of 35 in the city, identified through a national electronic ID system. The inclusion criteria included mild to moderate nausea, a gestational age of 6-10 weeks, and an age range of 18-35 years. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy complications and gastrointestinal issues. A sample size of 30 participants per group was determined, with 60 women meeting the criteria out of 150 evaluated.

The intervention group received supportive counseling based on positive psychology in 6 sessions, 3 times a week, with each session lasting 45-60 minutes. The sessions were conducted individually, covering topics such as pregnancy changes, personal hygiene, nutrition, and positive behavior competencies. The control group only received routine care. The outcome of the study was assessed using a pregnancy adjustment questionnaire and Rhode's nausea and vomiting severity scale, with data analyzed using SPSS 16, employing Chi-square tests, independent t-tests, and repeated measure ANOVA tests.
