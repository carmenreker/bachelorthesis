Methods Summary

Background: The study targeted women aged 50 and above with private insurance in Santiago, where half of Chile's population and a significant number of mammography facilities are located. This demographic was selected due to the availability of longitudinal insurance claims data, unlike those with public insurance. The study aimed to address the low mammography rates observed from the Chilean Socioeconomic Characterization Survey 2017, which showed only 35% of women in this age group had undergone mammography compared to 51% of privately insured women.

Data: The data, sourced from the Superintendence of Health, encompassed all claims from private insurance firms in Chile, focusing on women aged 50 to 61 who hadn't had a mammogram for at least 24 months. The final sample size was 15,626 women, representing 37% of the private insurance market, from which 12,000 were randomly selected into treatment and control groups. Data included information on mammograms from 2007 onwards, copay amounts, and primary care visits.

Experimental Strategy: The intervention involved mailing campaigns designed to overcome identified barriers such as information avoidance, procrastination, fear of test results, and complex structural barriers to accessing free mammograms. Four focus groups, each with 8 participants, helped refine these strategies. These interventions were tested through a nested 2x3 block design, resulting in eight types of treatment letters. Key strategies included reminders, deadlines with lottery incentives, expert endorsements, and simplified access instructions to clinics.

Outcomes: The effectiveness of the interventions was assessed by comparing means across treatment and control groups five months post-intervention, with additional regression analyses to control for interactions. Non-delivery of mailers due to address changes was noted, and compliance issues were addressed using an instrumental variable approach.

Ethics: The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Chileâ€™s School of Philosophy and Humanities on December 16, 2014. All participants provided written informed consent.
