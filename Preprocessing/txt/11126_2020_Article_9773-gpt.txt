The study involved 149 schizophrenia patients aged 18-65 diagnosed under ICD-10: F20.X, recruited from 14 German psychiatric university hospitals and clinics between April 2010 and May 2013 for the Neuroleptic Strategy Study (NeSSy). Inclusion required treatment initiation or change, excluding those with significant drug intolerance, acute suicidality, involuntary treatment, or conflicting somatic diseases. A total of 136 patients completed the study, randomized into typical (FGA: 69) and atypical (SGA: 80) antipsychotic groups based on therapeutic strategies, but data analysis included only 136 due to dropouts.

The study was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conforming to the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH, and GCP guidelines. Medications tested were two FGAs (haloperidol, flupentixol) and three SGAs (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine) administered over 24 weeks with a follow-up period of the same duration. Non-psychotropic medications were permitted.

Patients were assessed using the PSP scale which evaluates four functional domains: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and aggressive behavior. This scale, offering greater specificity and quick results, was rated at baseline and at 6 and 24 weeks. Additionally, other psychometric tools used included SF-36, CGI, SWN-K, PANSS, and Mini-ICF-APP for a comprehensive evaluation of symptoms and quality of life.

Data were analyzed on all patients who received at least one dose, focusing on AUC values of SF36 and CGI from day 1 to week 24, with missing values handled by LOCF and linear interpolation. Analyses were performed using SASÂ® version 9.4, with correlations determined by Pearson or Spearman methods, and secondary analyses were exploratory.
