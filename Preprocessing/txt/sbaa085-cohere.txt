Here is a summary of the methods section of the provided clinical trial: 

This clinical trial aims to investigate the effectiveness of online social cognition training for people with schizophrenia. The study protocol has been published previously, with relevant details described below. 

Participants:
- Clinically stable adults with schizophrenia were recruited from multiple sites: SFVAMC, UMN, UCLA, LAVA, and Rush University. 
- Participants met DSM-V criteria for schizophrenia, were 18-65 years old, had an IQ of at least 70, and were stable on their treatment for at least 6 weeks prior to consent. 
- Additional inclusion criteria included mild to moderate severity of hallucinations and no active suicidal ideation. 

Study Design:
- Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all participants provided informed consent.
- Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental (SocialVille) or active control (casual games) group, stratified by gender, education, and age.
- They were loaned laptops and asked to complete training from home, 3-5 times per week, for a total of 40 hours. 

Interventions:
- Experimental Group (SocialVille): 
  - SocialVille is a computerized cognitive training program consisting of 27 unique exercises targeting various social cognitive domains. 
  - Exercises aim to improve processing speed and accuracy in brain systems dedicated to social information processing. 

- Active Control Group: 
  - The control group received commercially available computer games that provided cognitive stimulation but did not have social content or individualized progression. 
  - This control condition matched the experimental group in overall program use intensity, staff interaction, reward, and engagement. 

Outcome Measures:
- Primary Outcome Measures: 
  - Social Cognition (SC) Composite: A composite score of 6 SC assessments measuring facial emotion recognition, prosody identification, memory for faces, emotional intelligence, and empathic accuracy. 
  - Functional Capacity: The UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA-2) measures skills in household chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities. 

- Secondary Outcome Measures: 
  - Clinical status and symptom severity (PANSS), functioning (VRFCAT, GFS, SFS, QLS, SLOF), additional SC measures (Morphed Faces Task, TASIT, Faux Pas Recognition Test, etc.), and motivation (TEPS, BIS/BAS scales). 

Data Analysis:
- Primary analysis compared groups on baseline measures using Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square tests. 
- Raw scores of primary SC outcomes were converted into Z-scores and normalized. 
- Due to group differences at baseline, a propensity score framework was used to compare trajectories of change over time, employing linear mixed-effects models and the intent-to-treat principle. 
- Statistical significance was set at a Bonferroni-adjusted P-value of .025.
