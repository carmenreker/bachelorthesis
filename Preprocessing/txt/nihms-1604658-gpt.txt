METHOD Participants:
Parent-adolescent dyads were recruited from a juvenile drug court in the northeastern United States. This program targets first-time or repeat nonviolent offenders who report active substance use. After referrals by a case manager or judge, 60 out of 283 referred families consented, were randomized, and 47 who underwent any intervention were analyzed. The study adhered to protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and participant characteristics are detailed in Tolou-Shams et al., 2017.

Interventions:
Participants were randomly allocated to either the Family-based Affect Management Intervention (FAMI; n = 25) or the adolescent-only Health Promotion Intervention (HPI; n = 22). FAMI aimed to curb substance use and HIV risk by enhancing emotional regulation and motivation in both adolescents and parents over five sessions. HPI, equally long, focused on educating adolescents about substance use, HIV prevention, and healthy behaviors. Intervention adherence and content specifics are also documented in Tolou-Shams et al., 2017.

Measures:
Evaluations employed the Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interview at baseline and three months post-intervention. Parental psychological distress was assessed via the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, focusing on a broad range of psychopathologies. Adolescents reported on substance use and risky sexual behaviors through the Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment and their mental health via the Youth Self-Report, measuring internalizing and externalizing problems.

Data Analysis:
Outcomes at post-intervention were analyzed by incorporating intervention type, initial parent distress, and their interaction, adjusting for baseline outcome levels. Substance use and risky behaviors were treated as both dichotomous and count variables to explore the extent and occurrence of these behaviors. Mental health outcomes were evaluated using linear regression, given their distribution conformed to normality. Analytical methods included logistic regression, generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution, and the Johnson-Neyman technique to pinpoint where interventions differed significantly. Missing data were addressed by imputing baseline values, with the exception of some participants who were excluded due to incomplete data entries. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 25 and Hayes' PROCESS macro.
