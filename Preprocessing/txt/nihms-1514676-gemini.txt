This is a summary of the methods section of a scientific clinical trial in the field of psychology. The study investigated the effects of a telephone-based positive psychology (PP) intervention for patients with bipolar disorder who were experiencing an acute depressive episode.

Participants were adults admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of bipolar depression. Bipolar depression diagnosis was confirmed using a standardized interview (MINI) and review of medical records. Participants were excluded if they exhibited psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, or had a substance use disorder.

The study was a single-blind, two-site randomized trial. Participants were randomized to either the PP intervention or a control condition (CC). The PP intervention consisted of four weekly telephone exercises designed to increase participants' positive emotions and optimism. The CC intervention involved recalling and writing about neutral events.

The primary outcome of the study was feasibility, measured by the number of PP exercises completed by participants and the proportion of participants who provided follow-up data. Secondary outcomes included the impact of the intervention on hopelessness, optimism, positive affect, gratitude, and depressive symptoms.

Here is a table summarizing the outcome measures used in the study:

| Outcome | Measure | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Feasibility | Number of PP exercises completed | The number of weekly telephone exercises that participants completed |
| Feasibility | Proportion of participants who provided follow-up data | The percentage of participants who completed follow-up assessments |
| Hopelessness | Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) | A 20-item self-report measure of hopelessness |
| Optimism | Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) | A 6-item self-report measure of optimism |
