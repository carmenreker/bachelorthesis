Method Participants
Twenty-three 12-month-old infants (8 males), twenty-four 18-month-old infants (11 males) and twenty-one 24-month-old children (9 males) were tested. All children were tested within three weeks of their birthday or half-birthday and all were healthy and typically developing. Families were recruited from a medium-sized city and surrounding suburbs and were predominantly white and middleclass (78% Caucasian; 7% African-American; 6% Asian; 1% Latino; 7% biracial). All children who began the task completed it. However, the analyzed data excluded one 12-month-old girl who did not touch any of the toys.

General Procedure
Infants first participated in a brief warm-up free play period to acclimate them to the laboratory setting, after which they were escorted with the mother to another room where testing occurred. The testing procedures were modeled closely on those used by Mumme and Fernald (2003). Stimuli were prerecorded video clips of a child displaying emotions toward toys, which infants viewed on a 44 cm color television monitor. During testing, infants were seated in a high chair positioned at the end of a table approximately 1.5 m away from the monitor. The mother sat 15 cm to the child's left, facing the child diagonally and with her back to the video display. Mothers filled out questionnaires and were instructed not to interact with the child. The experimenter sat to the right of the table obscured from the child's view by a curtain. The child's and parent's behavior were recorded with separate cameras.
The testing session consisted of three 50-s trials. Before each trial, the experimenter placed a pair of toys on a tray directly beneath the monitor, aligned with the video display and out of infants' reach. Each trial began with a 5-s video segment of an engaging abstract design to center the child's attention on the monitor. A trial consisted of a 20-s peer emotion display presented on the monitor followed by a 30-s play period with the pair of toys while the monitor displayed a blank screen. During the play period the experimenter, obscured behind the curtain, moved the tray of toys into the child's reach (using rods attached to the tray as in Mumme & Fernald, 2003) so that the toys were equidistant from the center of the child's body; the child was free to play with either or both of the toys. If the child dropped a toy out of reach, the parent immediately returned it to the tray without saying anything to the child. After 30-s of play, the experimenter signaled the parent to remove the toys from the infant and place them in a basket beneath the table. The first trial presented a neutral emotion that was the same for all children. The second trial presented either a positive or a negative emotion, manipulated between subjects. The third trial presented a positive emotion that was the same for all children and was included to ensure that the session always ended on a positive note; no data were collected from this trial.

Stimuli and Materials
Four novel toys were presented in pairs: a 14 cm red and blue spiral letter holder; a 14 cm blue rubber jack; a 12 cm green and black Y-shaped hose adaptor; a 12 cm plastic white tube with a red wing nut (adapted from Mumme & Fernald, 2003; see Figure 1). To create a standard set of peer emotion expressions, separate video presentations were constructed in which a young-looking 6-year-old girl gazed at and directed facial expressions and vocalizations toward one of the two novel toys in each pair using prototypical facial expressions and acoustic properties (Ekman & Friesen, 1975;Scherer, 1986). The two toys were positioned directly in front of her, approximately 30 cm apart on a white surface.
The same girl was used in all of the stimuli. She was young enough to appear visibly childlike but old enough to meet the demands of expressing neutral, positive, and fearful facial and vocal expressions toward a series of neutral objects. A female child was chosen to be consistent with previous social referencing studies that have employed female emotion informants to minimize stranger anxiety among infant participants. She was coached to display highly expressive positive and negative facial expressions (happy and fearful) while gazing at each of the neutral toys in turn. For the neutral stimulus she simply looked at the toy with interest while displaying a neutral facial expression. Investigators judged the emotion stimuli to be approximately equivalent in intensity. Facial expressions were accompanied by verbal descriptions of the toys (e.g., "It's red and white; it is made out of plastic") delivered with the matching vocal emotion; vocalizations were recorded separately and edited onto the video of the child's facial expressions.
In the first trial all children saw the peer display attention and simple interest toward one of the two toys. In the second trial, half the children saw the peer display positive emotion (happiness) toward one of the two toys, and the other half saw the peer display negative affect (fear). The peer directed attention and emotion to only one of the two toys on each trial (the "target" toy), with sides counterbalanced over the neutral and emotion trials. The other toy was unattended (the "distracter" toy). Each toy in a pair was the target toy for half of the infants, and the distracter toy for the other half. A different pair of toys was presented in each trial: the rubber jack was paired with the letter holder, accompanied by neutral affect; the hose adapter was paired with the plastic tube, accompanied by either positive or negative affect. For half of the infants the peer's positive or negative emotion was directed to the toy on the child's right, and for the other half the peer's emotion was directed to the toy on the child's left.

Measures
The first author and two research assistants coded the video data with sound muted. The camera displayed only the face of the infant and not the stimulus display, so all coders were blind to condition. The two relevant behaviors were total duration of looking at the video display during each presentation and total duration of touching each object during each play period. The first behavior ascertained that infants were attentive to the peer's emotions. The second behavior was the variable of interest. Coding was completed with the Noldusâ„¢ Observer 5.0 computer-based observation software.
Looking time-Looking was coded continuously as all time spent looking straight ahead toward the video display. Coding ended when the toy tray was pushed into view of the camera. Seventeen percent of tapes were coded for reliability by all three coders (average intraclass correlation = .85).
Touch time-Touching was coded continuously as any touch to the toys, including passive holding as well as active play and exploration, and both brief and prolonged touching of the toys. Touch to each toy separately and to both toys simultaneously were coded as mutually exclusive. Thus, if a girl began holding the tube and then picked up the hose adaptor with the other hand while retaining the tube, she would first be coded as touching only the tube, then be coded as touching both toys. Coding continued until the parent removed the first toy. Seventeen percent of tapes were coded for reliability by all three coders (average intraclass correlation = .96).
Although all children were given 30-s of play time with the toys, parents differed slightly in the amount of time they took to remove the first toy. Thus, in order to insure that coding was equated for amount of exposure to the toys, only the first 30-s of available play time were coded for each play period.
