## Summary of Methods in SocialVille Schizophrenia Trial

This study investigated the effectiveness of a web-based social cognition training program (SocialVille) for adults with schizophrenia.

**Participants:**

* Clinically stable adults with schizophrenia recruited from multiple US sites.
* Diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCID-P), aged 18-65, IQ â‰¥ 70 (WTAR).
* Minimally symptomatic (PANSS), no active suicidal ideation (C-SSRS).
* Stable medication regimen for at least 6 weeks.

**Study Design:**

* Participants were randomly assigned to either SocialVille training or a control group playing casual computer games.
* Allocation considered gender, education, and age for balanced groups.
* Participants completed training at home 3-5 times/week for a total of 40 sessions.

**Interventions:**

* SocialVille: A web-based program with 27 exercises targeting social skills like emotion recognition and perspective-taking.
* Control Group: Played 13 commercially available computer games with no social content.

**Outcome Measures:**

* Primary Outcomes:
    * Social cognition composite score (facial emotion recognition, prosody identification, etc.).
    * Functional capacity assessment (UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment).
* Secondary Outcomes:
    * Clinical symptoms (PANSS).
    * Functional capacity in daily activities (VRFCAT, GFS, etc.).
    * Additional social cognition assessments (TASIT, Faux Pas test).
    * Motivation (TEPS, BIS/BAS scales).

**Data Analysis:**

* Baseline group comparisons were conducted to ensure similar starting points.
* To account for baseline differences, propensity score analysis was used to create comparable groups.
* Changes in outcomes over time were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.
* Statistical significance was set at p < .025 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
