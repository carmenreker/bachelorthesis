## Summary of the Methods Section

This study examined the effectiveness of a family-based intervention (FAMI) compared to an adolescent-only intervention (HPI) in reducing substance use and emotional problems in adolescents with a history of substance use.

**Participants**

* Adolescents and parents were recruited from a juvenile drug court program.
* 60 families were enrolled and randomized to either FAMI or HPI.
* Adolescents reported current substance use but not necessarily drug-related offenses.

**Interventions**

* FAMI aimed to improve emotion regulation and motivation for adolescents and parents, focusing on behavior change. It included four bi-weekly sessions and one booster session.
* HPI provided psychoeducation on substance use, HIV prevention, and healthy behaviors. It matched FAMI in terms of time commitment.

**Measures**

* Parent distress was assessed using a self-report inventory (SCL-90-R).
* Adolescent substance use (marijuana and alcohol use days) and risky sexual behavior (number of acts) were self-reported during the past 90 days.
* Adolescent mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems) was assessed using a self-report measure (YSR).

**Data Analysis**

* Analyses considered intervention condition, baseline parent distress, and their interaction to predict outcomes at post-intervention.
* Different statistical models were used for different types of outcomes (dichotomous vs. count data).
* Missing data was addressed using imputation techniques.
