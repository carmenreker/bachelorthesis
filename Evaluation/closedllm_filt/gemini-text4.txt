Ethics Registration : studies approved Institutional Review Boards participants provided informed consent . studies registered Open Science Framework ( [ OSF link provided later ] ) . Detailed descriptions materials , analyses , deviations plans available Supplementary Information . Studies 1 , 2 , 4 pre-registered data analysis . Studies 3 , 5 , 6 pre-registered data analysis , followed rigorous standards constrain researcher bias . Intervention : intervention 30-minute online self-administered session . Participants randomly assigned intervention control group . conditions blinded ( participants researchers know group ) . Synergistic Mindsets Intervention : intervention aimed change negative mindsets stressful events . targeted two mindsets : Fixed mindset : belief intelligence fixed change . Stress-is-debilitating mindset : belief stress negative harms performance , health , well-being . intervention countered negative mindsets : Growth mindset : belief intelligence develop effort . Stress-can-be-enhancing mindset : belief stress helpful performance , health , well-being . Participants encouraged see challenges opportunities growth view stress body 's natural way help overcome challenges . intervention used educational materials , stories successful students , writing exercises reinforce messages . Adherence intervention high ( 82 % ) across studies . Control Group Content : control group also received 30-minute online self-administered session . content looked similar intervention target mindsets . included information brain , memory , body 's stress response system . Baseline Measures : Participants completed questionnaires assess negative mindsets beginning study ( except study 2 ) . Analysis Strategy : researchers used statistical method called Bayesian causal forests ( BCF ) analyze data . method designed conservative avoid misleading results . researchers focused estimating size treatment effect ( much intervention helped ) rather null hypothesis testing ( finding statistically significant results ) . Covariates ( factors could influence results ) included analysis account imbalances groups . Sample Size Participants : Study 1 aimed large , diverse sample ( 3,000 adolescents ) achieved final sample size 2,503 due pandemic limitations . Participants recruited public schools ( grades 8-12 ) represented mix genders , ethnicities , socioeconomic backgrounds . Study 2 included introductory social science college students ( N=83 ) predominantly female came range socioeconomic backgrounds . Procedure : Study 1 used online platform participants imagined stressful assignment reported appraisals intervention . also chose easy challenging assignment end . Study 2 involved students completing intervention control materials graded quiz reporting appraisals quiz . Measures : Study 1 assessed event-focused appraisals ( threat performance ) response-focused appraisals ( body 's stress response helpful hurtful ) . also measured behavioral intentions recording choices easy hard assignments . Study 2 used self-reported agreement statements whether body 's stress responses helped hurt quiz performance . Key Findings : Study 1 showed intervention increased likelihood choosing challenging assignment . Study 2 report main results yet , describe intervention impacted students ' appraisals stress responses quiz . Overall : studies aimed test feasibility initial effectiveness intervention different educational settings ( high school vs. college ) diverse populations . Study 5 : Daily Stress Responses Adolescents Participants : 118 adolescents low-income urban charter school ( 99 % economically disadvantaged families ) 78 % Black/African American , 5 % White Asian Grades 9-12 Procedure : Participants assigned one three groups : intervention , control , baseline measure . Intervention group received synergistic mindsets intervention tablet . groups completed daily diary entries ( twice day ) five consecutive school days , reporting stressors feelings day . Saliva samples also collected three times day measure cortisol levels ( stress hormone ) . Key Findings : study aimed assess intervention 's impact daily negative self-regard ( feelings oneself ) cortisol levels . Results explicitly mentioned likely presented future publication . Study 6 : Anxiety COVID-19 Lockdowns Participants : Undergraduate social science students university Study 2 . Procedure : Participants received intervention January 2020 . April 2020 ( COVID-19 lockdowns ) , completed survey measuring general anxiety symptoms . Key Findings : intervention group showed reduced general anxiety symptoms compared control group . Overall : studies aimed examine effectiveness intervention stress anxiety real-world settings ( daily life pandemic situation ) .
