Studies registered Open Science Framework , details available Supplementary Information . Pre-registration varied , studies registered data analysis others , adhering published operating procedures limit researcher bias . Intervention Overview intervention involved 30-minute , self-administered online session , employing random assignment via Qualtrics . Participants interacting individuals blinded condition assignments , ensuring double-blind design . intervention content aimed shift participants fixed growth mindset regarding stress , using established educational methods neuroscientific analogies . Control interventions mimicked format without promoting mindset malleability . Synergistic Mindsets Intervention intervention addressed fixed mindsets promoting perception stressful events controllable beneficial , countering belief static intellectual ability . juxtaposed idea stress enhance performance , framing physiological stress responses supportive rather detrimental . content reinforced stories , expressive writing tasks , engagement scientific research . Control Group Content control condition also lasted 30 minutes online , using similar aesthetics intervention group lacked claims intelligence malleability stress controllability . Study Designs Participants Studies varied setting , school environments online platforms , involving diverse participant groups adolescents university students . Measures included physiological responses , mindset appraisals , academic outcomes . Sample sizes determined based anticipated effect sizes , adjustments data collection constraints like COVID-19 pandemic . Analysis Strategy studies employed intention-to-treat analyses Bayesian causal forests , assessing treatment effects without re-fitting models excessively . method utilized conservative assumptions enhance reliability findings . Traditional linear models Bayesian approaches provided estimates treatment impacts various outcomes , including physiological stress responses academic performance .
