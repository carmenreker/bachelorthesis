## Summary of Methods Section in a Mindfulness Intervention Study on Students

This summary focuses on the recruitment process, intervention details, and outcome measures used in a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of mindfulness training on medical and psychology students.

**Participants and Recruitment**

* Second or third-year medical and psychology students from the University of Oslo and Troms√∏ were invited in 2009 and 2010.
* Students were informed during classes and invited via email to a website for more details and online signup.
* No mental health screening was performed because the program aimed at stress management and health promotion.
* Sample size was determined based on anticipated reductions in mental distress and medical school stress.

**Procedures**

* Randomization to intervention or control group was done electronically after baseline questionnaires (T1).
* The intervention group received a seven-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program. 
* The control group received no intervention.
* Questionnaires were completed again after the intervention (T2) with email reminders to encourage participation.
* Participants were compensated for their time with book vouchers.

**Description of the Intervention**

* The MBSR program was modified based on student input to reduce the time commitment. 
* It included mindfulness exercises, didactic teaching on stress and mindfulness, and group discussions.
* Instructors were qualified MBSR trainers with extensive mindfulness practice experience.

**Measures**

* Questionnaires assessed demographics, mental distress, student burnout, study stress, subjective well-being, and mindfulness. 
* Mental distress was measured using the GHQ12.
* Student burnout was assessed using a modified Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI).
* Perceived Medical School Stress (PMSS) scale was used to measure study stress.
* Subjective well-being (SWB) was assessed using a 4-item scale.
* The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) was used to measure mindfulness.
* Student compliance with the program was monitored through attendance and self-reported practice of mindfulness exercises.

**Statistical Analyses**

* Statistical methods were employed to assess the effectiveness of randomization, group differences at baseline, and intervention effects on various outcomes.
* Analyses considered factors like missing data and student gender.
* Effect sizes were calculated using Hedges' g and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was estimated for mental distress.
