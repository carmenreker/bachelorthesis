This study examined the effects of a two-year school-based positive psychology addiction prevention (PPAP) program on adolescents compared to a waiting-list control group.

**Participants**

* 1,670 students aged 10-16 (mean age 12.96) from six schools in Israel
* Randomly assigned to intervention or control group
* Exclusion criteria: ultra-orthodox religious schools, special education schools, non-comparable schools

**Procedure**

* Parental consent obtained
* Data collected at three points: before intervention (Sep 2019), intervention end (May 2021), one year after (May 2022)
* Students completed questionnaires on tablets in school during class time
* Research assistants blind to group assignment collected data
* Intervention group received the PPAP program delivered by trained teachers
* Control group continued with regular school curriculum

**Intervention Program (PPAP)**

* Two-year program consisting of 30 bi-weekly lessons (2 hours each)

* Life satisfaction (BMSLSS)
* Positive and negative emotions (PANAS-C)

* Substance use (AADIS)

**Statistical Analysis**

* Compared baseline characteristics between groups
* Analyzed changes in outcomes over time using growth curve models
* Considered demographic and school-level variables as covariates
* Used mixed-effects models to account for nested data structure (students within schools)
* Performed t-tests and chi-square tests for additional comparisons
