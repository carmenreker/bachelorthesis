## Summary of Methods Section in a Schizophrenia Treatment Study

This section describes a randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effectiveness of two treatment strategies for schizophrenia: typical and atypical antipsychotics.

**Patients:**

* Included: diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20.X), aged 18-65, requiring treatment initiation or change due to insufficient response or intolerability to previous medication.
* Excluded: known hypersensitivity to study drugs, acute suicidality, involuntary treatment, significant somatic diseases.
* Total: 149 patients recruited, 136 analyzed (13 dropped out before drug administration).

**Study Design:**

* Multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial at 14 German psychiatric hospitals.
* Patients randomized into two groups: one receiving a typical antipsychotic (FGA) and the other receiving an atypical antipsychotic (SGA).
* Treatment duration: 24 weeks.
* Follow-up: offered for 24 weeks after treatment cessation.

**Medications:**

* FGAs: haloperidol (3-6mg) or flupentixol (6-12mg).
* SGAs: aripiprazole (10-20mg), olanzapine (10-20mg), or quetiapine (400-800mg).
* Non-psychotropic medications allowed throughout the study.

**Assessments:**

* Primary outcome: area under the curve (AUC) of Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI) scores over 24 weeks.
* Secondary outcomes: Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptic Treatment Scale-Short Form (SWN-K), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Mini-ICF-APP, cognitive tests, and patient self-rated PSP.
* Assessments conducted at baseline, week 6 (visit 4), and week 24 (visit 6). Additional assessments at weeks 2, 4, and 12.

**Statistical Analysis:**

* Full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of medication.
* Missing values imputed by Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and linear interpolation.
* Primary efficacy analysis focused on AUC of SF36 and CGI scores.
* Secondary analyses exploratory.
* Statistical software: SASÂ® version 9.4.
