This section outlines the methods used in six studies investigating the effects of a synergistic mindsets intervention on adolescent and young adult stress appraisals and responses. The studies adhered to ethical guidelines and were registered on the Open Science Framework. The intervention aimed to convey that stressful events are controllable and potentially beneficial and targeted negative fixed mindset beliefs. It introduced the stress-can-be-enhancing mindset, suggesting that stress can enhance performance and well-being. Adherence to the intervention was defined as completing the last page. The control group received a similar online activity without mindset messages. Negative prior mindsets were measured at baseline using standard scales.

The analysis used a Bayesian regression approach, Bayesian Causal Forests, to estimate treatment effects and moderators. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted, and effect sizes were standardized. Manipulation checks assessed the intervention's impact on negative mindset beliefs. Sample size determination varied across studies, considering power, response rates, and data collection constraints. Participants included diverse adolescents and college students. Procedures involved online surveys, a laboratory-based stress induction paradigm, and daily diary measures. Outcome measures included self-reported appraisals, behavioural intentions, physiological indicators, and academic achievement.
