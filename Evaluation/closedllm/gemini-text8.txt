## Summary of Positive STEPS Trial Methods

This pilot study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a telephone-delivered intervention, Positive STEPS, for managing chronic pain in African American older adults. 

**Design:** Randomized, parallel-group with intervention and control conditions.

**Setting:** Detroit, Michigan (May to December 2020).

**Participants:** 
* Age 60+ years old
* Ambulatory with or without an assistive device
* Musculoskeletal pain lasting at least 3 months
* Smartphone or ability to watch videos online
* Excluded for: recent hospitalization, memory difficulties

**Intervention (Positive STEPS):**
* 7-week program delivered remotely via phone calls, website, and mailed materials
* Focused on cognitive-behavioral pain management skills and positive activities
* Culturally adapted for African American older adults
* Key components:
    * Weekly phone sessions with a community health worker (CHW)
    * Web-based videos on pain management and positive activities (participants chose from options like savoring and gratitude)
    * Workbook summarizing key points
    * Activity tracker (optional)

**Control Condition:**
* Did not receive any intervention between baseline and follow-up assessments
* Offered program materials and a one-time session with a CHW after follow-up

**Outcomes:**
* Primary: pain interference and physical functioning (measured by PROMIS scales)
* Secondary: participant global impression of change, pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, social participation, resilience, health & demographics
* Feasibility & Acceptability: retention rate, session completion, feedback from participants

**Data Analysis:**
* Statistical comparisons between intervention and control groups at baseline and follow-up
* Assessment of effect sizes and clinically important changes
