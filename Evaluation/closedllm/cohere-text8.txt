Here is a summary of the method section of the provided clinical trial: 

Method:

Study Design and Setting:
- Randomized, parallel-group pilot and feasibility trial conducted in Detroit, Michigan, from May to December 2020. 
- Participants randomized post-baseline assessment using computer-generated block randomization. 
- Trial registered on clinicaltrials.gov and approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board.

Intervention Development:
- "Positive STEPS" intervention adapted from the "STEPS 2" pilot, based on a successful internet CPSM intervention. 
- Focus groups (n=16; all female and African American with chronic musculoskeletal pain) provided feedback on potential positive activities. 
- CHWs (Community Health Workers) played a key role in refining content, reviewing materials, and providing cultural input.

Intervention Description:
- Completely remote intervention: materials mailed, sessions conducted over the phone, and online videos watched independently. 
- 7-week program: weekly 30-min telephone sessions with CHWs and web-based videos/workbook activities on cognitive-behavioral pain management skills and positive activities.
- Cultural adaptations included language adjustments, race-concordant presenters, and integration of cultural values like spirituality. 
- Core pain self-management skills: Understanding Chronic Pain, SMART Goal-Setting, Staying Active, and Doing What You Love.
- Positive activities: Life Review, Savoring, Random Acts of Kindness, Gratitude Jar, and Music as Medicine.

CHW-led Component:
- CHWs delivered the intervention after a half-day training session. 
- Session format included reinforcing key points, discussing participants' situations, creating a "Try it Out" plan, and setting an "Active Goal" for activity increase. 
- CHWs reviewed step counts and referred to community resources. 
- Session information was recorded using REDCap data capture tools.

Positive STEPS Website:
- Website included CHW introductions and separate pages for each module with didactic videos and additional resources.

Activity Trackers:
- Wrist-worn activity trackers provided to participants to monitor daily step counts. 
- Automated text messages requested step count input each evening.

Control Condition:
- Control group completed baseline and follow-up surveys with no intervention. 
- Given access to website, workbook, and activity tracker post-study.

Participants:
Inclusion criteria:
- Adults aged 60+, with musculoskeletal pain for â‰¥ 3 months, impacting daily activities. 
- Required smartphone or means to watch online videos.

Exclusion criteria:
- Serious acute illness, hospitalization, or planned surgery. 
- Memory difficulties interfering with daily activities.

Recruitment:
- Registry for African American older adults, community locations in Detroit, and researcher-maintained lists.

Data Collection:
- Telephone interviews at baseline and 8-week follow-up, including self-reported health, psychosocial, and demographic measures. 
- Intervention group had additional questions about their experience.

Measures:
Primary Outcomes:
- Pain interference and physical functioning measured using PROMIS subscales.

Secondary Outcomes:
- Participant global impression of change, pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, social participation, and resilience.
- Health and demographic variables collected.

Feasibility and Acceptability:
- Retention, engagement (number of sessions completed), and acceptability (feedback on intervention components) assessed.

Data Analysis:
- IBM SPSS Statistics used for data analysis, including descriptive statistics and group comparisons. 
- PROMIS subscale scores converted to T-scores.
- Univariate analysis of variance models assessed the intervention effect on outcomes, with baseline values as covariates. 
- Chi-squared tests compared the proportion achieving Minimally Important Difference in pain interference. 
- Frequencies calculated for closed-ended satisfaction items, and open-ended responses categorized and tallied.
