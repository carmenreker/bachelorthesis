This study examined the willingness of risky drinkers to participate in an alcohol prevention intervention offered in a workplace setting. The data was collected in Norway as part of a larger project named WIRUS.

**Participants and Recruitment:**

* A total of 30,811 employees were invited to complete an alcohol screening survey.
* Risky drinkers (n=800) were identified based on their AUDIT scores.
* After excluding those with missing contact information, 779 employees were invited for a health examination by the Occupational Health Services (OHS).

**Intervention:**

* Employees attending the health examination were offered participation in a randomized controlled trial with three conditions:
    * Face-to-face motivational interviewing with OHS personnel
    * Digital self-help program
    * Control group receiving only an alcohol information booklet
* All participants received the information booklet.

**Measures:**

* Willingness to participate was defined as responding positively to the OHS invitation, attending the health examination, and consenting to randomization.
* Sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol use, and work-related factors were measured through questionnaires.

**Analysis:**

* The proportion of willing participants was calculated.
* Associations between willingness and various factors were analyzed using chi-square tests and t-tests.
* Logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of willingness to participate.

**Ethical Considerations:**

* Informed consent was obtained at all stages of the study.
