 The study was a controlled randomized controlled trial conducted from October 2020 to May 2021 in Zanjan city, Iran, with ten randomly selected comprehensive health centers. The research targeted pregnant women with nausea and vomiting (NVP) and included those with mild to moderate symptoms, gestational ages of 6-10 weeks, and ages 18-35 years. Participants had to be literate, have a contact phone number, and desire for a wanted pregnancy. Exclusions were based on pregnancy complications, gastrointestinal diseases, traumatic or stressful recent events. The sample size was calculated to be 30 per group, considering a 10% dropout rate, with a total of 60 participants. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups using a four-block method. The intervention group received six individual sessions of supportive counseling based on positive psychology protocols, while the control group received routine care. Data were collected using specific tools like the Rhodes nausea and vomiting severity scale and demographic questionnaires. The outcomes measured were coping patterns with pregnancy before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 16, with various statistical tests to evaluate the effect of time, group, and their interaction.
