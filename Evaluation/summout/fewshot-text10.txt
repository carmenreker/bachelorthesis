 The study involved 56 infants (23, 18, and 21 months of age) from a predominantly white, middle-class background. All participants completed the task, but data from one 12-month-old girl who showed no interest in the toys were excluded from analysis. Infants were tested individually and observed by separate coders using specialized software. They were shown videos of a peer expressing positive or negative emotions towards toys while maintaining eye contact. The toys were within the child's reach, and the mother was present but instructed not to interact with the child. The experimenter, hidden from view, moved a toy tray to the child's reach during a video presentation. Following the video, the mother removed the toys, and the child's looking and touching behaviors were recorded. The study utilized a coding system for both behaviors, ensuring reliability through intercoder agreement. The toys and peer's expressions were novel, and the experimenter's actions were consistent across trials. The study's focus was on the infants' social referencing behaviors, specifically their reactions to the peer's emotions and subsequent interactions with the toys.
