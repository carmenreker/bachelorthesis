 The study utilized a prospective design involving 779 employees identified as risky drinkers from 22 Norwegian companies. Participants were recruited through occupational health services (OHS) and invited to a health examination, where they could opt to participate in an alcohol prevention intervention. The selection criteria for the study included being a risky drinker, aged 16-72, employed in a company with OHS involvement, having basic Norwegian language skills, and completing the alcohol screening survey.

During the health examination, employees were informed about the randomized controlled trial and the possibility of joining an alcohol prevention intervention. They could choose between a face-to-face brief intervention, an eHealth intervention, or a control condition. The willingness to participate was determined by employees' responses to the OHS invitation, attendance at the health examination, and agreement to randomization.

Sociodemographic and alcohol-related variables were considered as potential correlates for willingness to participate. These included age, gender, education, marital status, living situation, children, income, AUDIT scores, and drinking norms. Work-related and lifestyle variables were also included due to the occupational setting and the potential influence of contextual factors.

The study's ethical considerations aligned with the Declaration of Helsinki, ensuring participants' rights to dignity, integrity, self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality. Informed consent was obtained, and the study received approval from the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research in Norway.
