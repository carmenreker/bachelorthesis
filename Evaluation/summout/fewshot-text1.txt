 The study focused on patients aged 18 to 65 with schizophrenia, requiring treatment due to inadequate response or intolerability to prior medication, excluding those with hypersensitivity to study drugs, acute suicidality, involuntary treatment, or significant medical conditions interacting with antipsychotic treatment. Patients were randomized into two groups, one receiving a conventional antipsychotic and the other a new antipsychotic, with 136 patients from 14 centers in Germany participating. The randomization did not exclude patients with tardive dyskinesia. Data were collected at multiple points, including sociodemographic details, and utilized various scales for assessment, such as the PSP, SF-36, CGI, and others. The primary endpoint was analyzed using AUC values over a 24-week period, with missing data handled through imputation. The study adhered to ethical guidelines and was managed statistically with SAS version 9.4.
