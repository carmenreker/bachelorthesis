 The study was a randomized, parallel-group pilot and feasibility trial conducted in Detroit, Michigan, evaluating the Positive STEPS intervention for older African American adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Participants, aged 60 and older, were recruited from a registry and through community locations, with a broad inclusion criterion of having chronic pain. The intervention group underwent a 7-week program delivered remotely, involving weekly web-based videos and phone sessions with a CHW, focusing on pain management and positive activities like savoring and gratitude. The control group received general information and a one-time CHW session. The Positive STEPS intervention was developed based on previous successful content, refined through focus groups for cultural relevance, and included core pain management skills and selected positive activities. The intervention was delivered via a website, phone sessions, and activity tracking. Data were collected through telephone interviews, with completion incentives and optional activity tracker use. The primary outcome was pain interference measured by the PROMIS-43 Adult Profile, with secondary outcomes including physical functioning, pain self-efficacy, and resilience. The intervention's effect was assessed using independent-sample t-tests and chi-squared tests, with a particular interest in the proportion of participants achieving a significant clinical improvement.
