 The study involved medical and psychology students from the University of Oslo and the University of Troms√∏, recruited through class invitations and online information dissemination. No exclusion criteria were applied, and students were not screened for mental illness. The sample size was determined by the expected 20% reduction in mental distress and medical school stress, with a target of 60-100 students per group. The intervention, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), was adapted from Kabat-Zinn's program and conducted over seven weeks, including six sessions and daily home practice. Measures included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12), a Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) tailored for students, a Perceived Medical School Stress (PMSS) scale, and a Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Data were collected through online questionnaires, and missing data were handled using the last-observation-carried-forward method. The study employed multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) to assess intervention effects on mental health and mindfulness, adjusting for baseline measures and class and university factors. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was calculated to evaluate the clinical significance of the intervention's impact on mental distress.
