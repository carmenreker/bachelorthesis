 The study focused on patients aged 18 to 65 with a schizophrenia diagnosis, requiring treatment due to inadequate response or intolerance to previous medication. Exclusion criteria were specific, such as hypersensitivity to study drugs or severe somatic diseases. Patients with cannabis abuse were not excluded. Tardive dyskinesia was not a criterion for exclusion but was monitored. A total of 136 patients from 149 initially recruited were included in the final analysis, with 63 on the conventional antipsychotic group and 73 on the new antipsychotic group. Data were collected through various scales, including the PSP, SF-36 for quality of life, and the Mini-ICF-Rating for symptoms. The study employed a double-blind, randomized design across 14 centers in Germany, with patients assessed at multiple points over 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the assessment of AUC values for SF-36 and CGI, with missing data imputed using LOCF. Secondary analyses were exploratory.
