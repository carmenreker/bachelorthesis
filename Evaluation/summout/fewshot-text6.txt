 The study utilized the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the process of an ongoing randomized controlled trial within the WIRUS project, focusing on the reach category. A digital alcohol screening survey was initially distributed to 30,811 employees across 22 companies in Norway, with a 27.7% response rate and 8,542 employees completing the survey. Of these, 779 risky drinkers were identified and contacted by occupational health services (OHS). The study included employees aged 16-72, of any gender, working in various sectors, with basic Norwegian language skills and who scored eight or higher on the AUDIT. Willingness to participate in an alcohol prevention intervention was determined by responding positively to the OHS invitation, attending the health examination, and consenting to randomization. Sociodemographic, alcohol-related, work-related, and lifestyle variables were considered as potential correlates for willingness to participate. Data were analyzed using t-tests and binary logistic regression, with significant correlates identified at a p-value threshold of 0.05. Ethical considerations were strictly adhered to, with informed consent obtained from all participants at multiple stages.
