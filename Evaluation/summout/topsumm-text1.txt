 The study focused on evaluating typical and atypical antipsychotics in patients aged 18 to 65 with schizophrenia, requiring treatment due to inadequate response or intolerance to previous medication. Exclusion criteria included severe hypersensitivity to study drugs, acute suicidality, compulsory treatment, and significant somatic diseases. Patients with cannabis abuse were not excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to either a conventional or new antipsychotic group in a double-blind, double-dummy design across 14 German psychiatric centers. The final analysis included data from 136 patients out of 149 initially recruited, with the primary endpoint being the assessment of the Patient's Situation Profile (PSP), a tool providing a detailed evaluation of social and personal functioning. Secondary measures included quality of life, subjective well-being, PANSS, and additional cognitive and social functioning tests. Data were collected at multiple points, and missing values were imputed using specific methods. The study employed logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization for analysis, and the final sample consisted of 5,680 participants after exclusions for incomplete data. The study maintained strict adherence to ethical guidelines and involved multiple psychometric assessments to evaluate various aspects of patient functioning and treatment outcomes.
