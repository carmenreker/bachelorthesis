 The study involved healthy women aged 60 and older, who were screened for low generative achievement relative to their generative desire. A total of 73 female participants, with a mean age of 70.9 years, were randomized into either a generativity or control writing condition. The generativity group wrote weekly about life experiences to share wisdom with middle-aged adults, while the control group wrote about neutral topics. All participants provided written consent, and the study was approved by the UCLA Human Subjects Protection Committee. The study's general design and primary outcomes were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.
