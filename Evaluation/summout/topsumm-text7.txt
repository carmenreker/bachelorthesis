 The study focused on healthy women aged 60 and older to explore the impact of writing about life experiences on their mental health. Participants were randomly assigned to a generativity writing intervention or a control group that wrote about neutral topics. The intervention aimed to enhance participants' generativity, with their writings later potentially benefiting middle-aged adults. The final sample consisted of 73 women, with 35 in the generativity condition and 38 in the control condition. All participants provided written consent, and the study was approved by the UCLA Human Subjects Protection Committee. Data collection occurred over six weeks, and participants completed self-report measures assessing mental health beliefs, social provisions, and loneliness at various points. The primary outcome measures included the ERA Survey and the Social Provisions Scale, with additional measures like the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The study utilized the PROCESS macro for analysis to examine the moderating effect of generativity on social well-being outcomes, controlling for pre-intervention levels.
