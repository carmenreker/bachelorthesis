This paper presents the methodology of six studies examining the impact of a mindset intervention on stress appraisals and coping among adolescents. These studies were designed with ethical approval and included diverse adolescent participants. Data collection involved informed consent, with participants either providing self-reports or attending sessions and laboratory tasks. An overview of the interventions, which were online and focused on promoting growth and stress-as-challenge mindsets, reveals that they included reading materials, writing exercises, and mindset-related prompts. The interventions were compared to control conditions that either did not address mindsets or discussed growth mindset without stress reappraisal. The studies used various measures, including self-report questionnaires, physiological indicators of stress responses, and behavioral intentions. Data analysis strategies varied across studies but commonly included intention-to-treat approaches, and some utilized Bayesian causal forests to estimate treatment effects and moderators. The studies also implemented measures to reduce researcher degrees of freedom, such as pre-registered plans and conservative statistical methods. Synergy mindsets was the operational intervention, with control conditions serving as comparison groups. The results of these studies are not included in the summary.
