 The study was a controlled trial conducted in Zanjan's health centers, assessing the impact of positive psychology counseling on pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Sixty out of 60 eligible pregnant women were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, receiving six sessions of positive psychology counseling, or the control group, which received routine care. The counseling aimed to improve coping strategies for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. The intervention group showed significant improvement in their ability to cope with pregnancy challenges, as measured by a specialized questionnaire assessing various coping strategies across different stages of pregnancy. The counseling's effectiveness was evaluated using statistical tests, and the results indicated a small to moderate effect size.
