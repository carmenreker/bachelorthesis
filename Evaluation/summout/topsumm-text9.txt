 The study involved 1,670 students from six demographically similar schools in Israel, aged 10 to 16, utilizing a two-stage random sampling method. Six schools were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group, with the intervention group receiving a two-year Positive Psychology Addiction Prevention (PPAP) program. The PPAP program, consisting of 30 lessons delivered by trained teachers, focused on addiction prevention and positive psychology constructs. The control group continued with their regular curriculum without additional prevention programs. Data were collected at three points: before the intervention, at the end of the intervention, and one year after, using various measures of mental health, substance use, and life satisfaction. The final sample for analysis included 5,680 students after excluding incomplete responses. The study employed mixed model growth curve analyses to examine changes over time, with significant differences analyzed using t-tests and chi-square tests. The study also considered school and classroom-level factors as potential influences on the outcomes.
