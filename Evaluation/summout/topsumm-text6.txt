 The study aimed to evaluate the willingness of 779 identified risky drinkers from Norwegian companies to participate in an alcohol prevention intervention as part of a process evaluation in the WIRUS project. Participants were recruited through company-provided email addresses and completed a screening survey; those scoring high on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were classified as risky drinkers. Out of 30,811 invited, 8,542 employees (27.7%) consented, with 779 meeting the risky drinker criteria. Participants were then invited to a health examination, where they could be randomized into an intervention or control group. The interventions included a face-to-face motivational interviewing session and information booklet, a digital eHealth program, or a control group receiving only the information booklet. Willingness to participate was determined by positive responses to the invitation, attendance at the health examination, and agreement to randomization. Sociodemographic, alcohol-related, work-related, and lifestyle variables were analyzed to identify correlates of willingness to participate. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted on these correlates. The study adhered to ethical standards, ensuring voluntary participation and confidentiality.
