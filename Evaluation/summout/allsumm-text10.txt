 The study involved 56 infants (23 12-month-olds, 24 18-month-olds, and 21 24-month-olds) from a predominantly white, middle-class background, who were healthy and typically developing. All infants completed the task, but data from one 12-month-old girl were excluded due to her lack of interaction with the toys. The procedure involved an initial acclimation period, followed by a testing phase where infants observed a video of a peer expressing emotions towards toys. Three trials per session showed a neutral emotion, a positive emotion, or a negative emotion directed at one of two toys. The toys were placed within the infant's reach, and the mother was instructed not to interact with the child. The child's and mother's behaviors were recorded. The first behavior measured infants' attention to the peer's emotions, while the second behavior recorded the infant's touching of the toys. Data were collected by coders and analyzed to assess the impact of the peer's emotional expressions on the infant's interaction with the toys.
