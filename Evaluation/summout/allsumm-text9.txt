 The study involved 1,670 students from six demographically similar schools in Israel, aged 10 to 16 years. Two-stage random sampling was employed, with school principals randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Six schools were randomly selected for the intervention group to receive the Positive Psychology Addiction Prevention (PPAP) program, while the control group continued with their regular curriculum. PPAP, a two-year program with 30 lessons, focused on addiction prevention and positive psychology constructs. It included modules on self-awareness, addiction resistance, and various other well-being topics. Teachers received extensive training to implement the program, and fidelity checks were conducted to ensure consistency. The control group served as a comparison and started the program after the intervention concluded. Data were collected at three points: before the intervention, at the end of it, and one year later, using validated self-report measures for mental health, life satisfaction, and substance use. The study utilized mixed model growth curve analyses to examine changes over time, with significant findings suggesting that the intervention had an impact on the students' reported levels of positive and negative emotions, as well as substance use behaviors. Gender and school-level factors were also considered in the analysis. The study's design, intervention, and data collection methods are detailed, with no additional assumptions made beyond the information provided.
