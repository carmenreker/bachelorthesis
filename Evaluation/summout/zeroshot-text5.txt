 The study recruited medical and psychology students from the University of Oslo and the University of Troms√∏ in 2009 and 2010. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which received the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, or the control group. The MBSR program, based on Kabat-Zinn's model, was adapted to fit the students' schedules and included seven weekly sessions, a final session, and daily home practice. The instructors were trained and qualified to conduct the MBSR program.

The intervention aimed to reduce mental distress, study stress, student burnout, and increase subjective well-being and mindfulness. The MBSR program included physical and mental exercises, didactic teaching, and a group process. The program's effectiveness was measured using various scales and questionnaires assessing mental distress, burnout, stress, well-being, and mindfulness. Student compliance was also measured.

The study found significant differences between the intervention and control groups in terms of mental distress, burnout, stress, and well-being. The intervention group also showed increased mindfulness. The study also found that the intervention's effects depended on the student class and university location. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was calculated to assess the clinical importance of the intervention on mental distress.
