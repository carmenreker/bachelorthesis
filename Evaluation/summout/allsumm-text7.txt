 The study focused on healthy women aged 60 and older who felt a discrepancy between their generative desire and generative achievement. A total of 73 women were randomly assigned to a generativity writing intervention or a control group, neither informed about the specific purpose of the writing task. The intervention group was tasked with writing about their life experiences and imparting wisdom to a broader audience, while the control group wrote about neutral topics. All participants provided written consent, and the study was approved by the UCLA IRB. The primary aim was to explore whether writing could moderate perceptions of social support and feelings of loneliness, measured using the ERA Survey, Social Provisions Scale, and UCLA Loneliness Scale. Data were analyzed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS to test for interactions between the intervention and participants' beliefs about aging and mental health on these outcomes.
