 The study involved 23 12-month-old infants, 24 18-month-old infants, and 21 24-month-old children, totaling 68 participants. All were healthy, typically developing, and predominantly white and middle-class. Families were recruited from a medium-sized city and surrounding suburbs. The children were tested within three weeks of their birthday or half-birthday.

During the experiment, infants were first acclimated with a brief free play period. They were then tested individually in a room with their mothers, where they viewed video clips of a child expressing emotions towards toys. The testing setup included a high chair, a monitor, and a tray of toys placed out of reach.

The testing session comprised three 50-second trials. Each trial included a video segment to focus the child's attention, followed by a peer emotion display and a 30-second play period with the toys. The toys were moved within reach by the experimenter, and the mother was instructed not to interact with the child.

Stimuli included four novel toys and video clips of a young girl expressing neutral, positive, and negative emotions towards the toys. The girl was chosen to minimize stranger anxiety and to standardize the expression of emotions.

The measures taken were total looking time at the video display and total touch time with the toys. These behaviors were recorded and coded for reliability. The study excluded one 12-month-old girl who did not interact with the toys.
