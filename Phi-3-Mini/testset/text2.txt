Methods


Patients
Patients ranging from 18 to 65 years old had to present with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20.X) to be included in the study. They had to require treatment initiation or change in treatment due to an insufficient response or intolerability to their previous prescribed medication. Exclusion criteria included known hypersensitivity or profound intolerability to one of the study drugs, acute suicidality, treatment on an involuntary legal basis, and the presence of somatic diseases considered by the investigator as significantly interacting with antipsychotic treatment or study procedures. Cannabis abuse was not an exclusion criterion. To avoid selection bias, the presence of tardive dyskinesia did not exclude patients from randomization into an FGA. However, none of the patients included in the study presented with tardive dyskinesia at baseline. Patients had to provide written informed consent to participate in the study.
A total of 136 patients with schizophrenia were registered for the multicentre, randomized, double-blind Neuroleptic Strategy Study (NeSSy) [4] carried out with 14 German psychiatric university hospitals and clinics between April 2010 and May 2013. Typical and atypical antipsychotics were compared on the basis of different therapeutic strategies. A total of 149 patients with schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20.X) were randomized into two groups (FGA: 69; SGA: 80). The data of 136 patients were evaluated.
For this study, 149 patients were recruited, but the full analysis data set for the PSP consisted of only 136 patients because 13 of them did not take part due to drop-out before the administering of drugs (medication) or they did not take the study drugs due to non-compliance. There were 63 patients in the conventional antipsychotic group and 73 patients in the new antipsychotic group. The PSP questionnaires conducted with doctors and patients were completed three times (Visit V0, Visit V4 in week number 6 and Visit V6 in week number 24).

Sociodemographic Parameters
Out of 136 patients from the full analysis set, 122 filled in the sociodemographic part of the PSP self-rating. Table 1 shows the baseline profiles of 136 patients regarding age, sex, diagnosis, duration, severity of depression (item 6 of PANSS), PANSS total, and baseline profiles of the 122 patients regarding sociodemographic parameters.

Study Design
This multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised study was performed at 14 psychiatric university and state hospitals in Germany. The study was approved by the respective ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and current regulatory requirements. Project management, monitoring, data management, and statistical analysis were conducted and supervised by the Competence Centre for Clinical Trials of the University of Bremen.

Medication
Patients were randomised in a double-blind fashion (random table, block length 30) into two intervention groups, one of which pursued the strategy to apply an FGA and the other the strategy of treatment with an SGA. Two FGAs (haloperidol [3-6 mg] or flupentixol [6-12 mg]) and three SGAs (aripiprazole [10-20 mg], olanzapine [10-20 mg], or quetiapine [400-800 mg]) were selected. Non-psychotropic drugs for the treatment of other medical conditions were allowed throughout the study. All treatments were administered over the duration of 24 weeks until failure of therapeutic response or until the occurrence of major or intolerable adverse events. After cessation of treatment within the study, patients were offered follow-up services for another 24 weeks.

The PSP and Other Psychometric Scales
Morosini and staff [5] developed the PSP. This assessment is based on four dimensions: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing or aggressive behaviour. Compared with the GAF and SOFAS that have been traditionally applied, the PSP implies several advantages. On the one hand, psychopathological symptoms are not mixed with psychosocial aspects on the PSP so that there is a more exact, specific operationalizing of vocational, social, and personal functioning. On the other hand, the four subscales that comprise the total score generated only in the second step are collected beyond a global value. With these four subscales, the PSP creates a higher specific validity than the traditional GAF and SOFAS scales. Furthermore, the scale's ability to generate quick results must be positively emphasized [5]. In preliminary studies with acute and chronic schizophrenic patients, the scale showed high values of reliability and validity [2,3]. Thus, the PSP is a third-party assessment tool.
Patient difficulties were rated in each individual section as absent, slight, obvious, distinctive, severe, or extremely severe. After the patient was assessed in terms of the four dimensions, individual values were summarized into a total score; this was done on a scale of 1-100 defined in ranges of 10, where a range must be chosen with individual scores. However, in daily clinical practice the comparison between individual dimensions and therefore different functional areas is of greater practical relevance than the consideration of the total score, since by repeated assessment of the four dimensions in longitudinal section, variations in courses of therapy (short, medium, long) can be detected objectively by repeated assessment of the four dimensions. Additionally, the handling of the PSP is quite easy; only a short training is required.
Table 2 shows the baseline values and pre-post difference for PSP and PSP self-ratings together with the test results. To evaluate secondary target criteria, the difference between V6 and V0 was analysed by default. If the value for visit V0 was missing, the value of V4 was 'rewritten forward' First Observation Carried Backwards (FOCB), which means the difference between V6 and V0 was replaced by the difference between V6 and V4. In the case of missing values for V6, the Last-Observation-Carried-Forward (LOCF) method was used, meaning that V6 to V0 was replaced by V4 to V0. If only one single value was available, there was no difference calculation. In some cases, the change from V0 to V4 (short-term development) was interesting; therefore, the difference between V4 and V0 was additionally calculated.
In addition, the following scales were used: (a) quality of life assessed with the sum of the physical and mental component summary of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)15 and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S), or the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) for sexual dysfunction [6]; (b) Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptic Treatment Scale-Short Form (SWN-K); (c) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [4]; (d) Mini-ICF-APP (developed by M. Linden); and (e) Mini-ICF-Rating for mental disordersa short, third-party assessment tool consisting of 12 items that enabled us to operationalize and quantify incapacitating symptoms. The patient's ability for example to perform daily living or daily structure was assessed with a 5-step Likert-type scale from 0 (no impairment) to 4 (full impairment) [7].
The assessment of item 9ability to participate in family relationswas rated on a 5-step scale for each of the four groups of persons. To obtain a value for item 9, the mean value of all existing values was generated. Likewise, item 10ability to perform non-vocational activities was divided into household chores and recreational activities. Here too, the mean values of both sub-areas were generated before the calculation of the global value. A summarizing assessment of incapacities was confured by generating a mean value over all 12 dimensions according to an overall value [8]. The assessment of cognitive scores is done by the Trail Making Test (A and B) (TMT), the "Regensburg Word Fluency Test' (RWT), the "Letter-

Number-Test' (BZT), the "Verbal Learn and Memory Test' (VLMT) and the Multiple Choice Vocabulary Test (MWT-B).
All parameters were recorded at baseline and after 6 (visit 4) and 24 weeks (visit 6). In addition, the primary endpoints and safety parameters were assessed after 2, 4, and 12 weeks (visits 2, 3, and 5).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed on the full analysis set (FAS) consisting of all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The primary efficacy analysis was dedicated to AUC values of SF36 and CGI with a logarithmic time scale from day 1 to week 24, integrating the effect curve with regard to its typical form of early effects flattening out for later visits. Missing values were imputed by LOCF and linear interpolation, respectively. LOCF is more conservative but offers the advantage of implicitly taking into account the time points of dropouts. Secondary tests were always only exploratory. All scores were summarized first in concordance with the original guide, publication, or manual. Correlations were computed by Pearson, respectively, and the Spearman approach, depending on scale properties. The analysis was performed with SASÂ® version 9.4.
