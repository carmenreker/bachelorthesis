Method


Participants
The sample was composed of 1,670 fifth to tenth grade students aged 10 to 16 at the beginning of the study (M = 12.96, SD = 2.01) from six demographically similar elementary and secondary schools throughout Israel. A two-stage random sampling method was used. Two supervisors from the local Education Departments presented the program to the school principals in their cities. Twenty-two principals who consented to participation and the random assignment to intervention or waiting-list control group continued to the second stage. The exclusion criteria were ultra-orthodox religious schools (schools catering to the highly religious sector in Israel that have their own education system that provides a curriculum of intensive religious education), special education schools, and demographically non-comparable schools. Blind randomization was performed by running a randomization script over the list of the schools' encrypted codes. Of the 22 eligible schools, six schools were randomly selected and assigned to the intervention or control groups by an independent researcher.
G-Power software was used to determine the appropriate sample size for the repeated measure MANOVA design. A sample size of 289 was required to achieve power of 0.80 for a medium effect size of 0.25 and an alpha of 0.05. A larger sample size was used to achieve greater statistical power.

Procedure
After obtaining ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of Reichman University, parents were sent parental consent forms for their children's participation. The students were informed that their participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous and were asked for their active consent. The data were collected in three waves: before the beginning of the intervention (September 2019), at the end of the intervention (May 2021), and a year after the completion of the program (May 2022), during the school day on tablets in the presence of research assistants who were blind to group assignment. To minimize performance bias, the intervention and control group students were blind to the purposes of the study. The students were not exposed to other school prevention interventions than the PPAP program.

Intervention program: Positive psychology addiction prevention (PPAP)
The PPAP is a two-year school-based program consisting of 30 units lasting two hours each, delivered by trained classroom teachers to children and adolescents during the school year. The program integrates addiction evidence-based prevention strategies along with facets of wellbeing and validated positive-psychology constructs. It consists of highly interactive training in self-awareness, addiction resistance skills, normative beliefs, information about the harmful effects of substance use and digital media overuse, motivational dialogue, problem solving, decision making, emotion regulation, positive emotions, character strengths, resilience and coping with stress, social support, healthy interpersonal relationships, flow and engagement, goal setting, and meaning in life. The program's main features are presented in Table 1.
Clinical psychologists delivered the preparatory training program to 30 teachers in the intervention schools. The teachers then implemented an age-appropriate program in their classrooms. The teacher training and the student program were composed of 30 two-hour sessions that were implemented every-two weeks during two school years, such that the teachers' training preceded the students' lessons on the same topic that the teachers implemented in their classrooms. The students' program lessons were delivered during the school day as part of the school curriculum. Throughout the two years of the program, there were four lockdowns, in which the sessions were conducted via Zoom.
The teachers were provided an in-depth manual including detailed lesson plans and class activities for each of the 30 sessions, to ensure standardization of the program. In addition, the teachers received PowerPoint presentations and supporting multi-media materials for each lesson. Throughout their training, the teachers shared their reflections on the lessons they delivered in their classes and received guidance from their training instructor for future implementation.
Implementation fidelity. The training instructors and the school psychological counselors conducted observations throughout the study to assess the fidelity of implementation of the intervention program. The school counselors were also responsible for monitoring the frequency and quality of the PPAP implementation. The teachers completed a validated competence and adherence measure after each lesson (Shoshani et al., 2016) and submitted it to their school counselor for follow-ups. On average, the teachers delivered 29 of the 30 lessons during the two years (M = 29.14, SD = 0.63), and reported feelings of success in implementing the subjects of each lesson (M = 4.32, SD = 0.57). High adherence to the lesson plan was reported by the teachers (M = 4.61, SD = 0.67) and school counselors (M = 4.57, SD = 0.73).

Control group
The waiting-list control group continued with the regular school curricula. The control group did not take part in any mental health or addiction prevention program during the study and only started the program after the completion of the study. (BSI-18;Derogatis, 2001) The BSI-18 measures mental health symptoms in children and adolescents. This 18-item instrument generates four subscale scores (anxiety, depression, somatization, and panic) as well as a global score (The Global Severity Index, GSI). The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "not at all" to "very strong". The Cronbach's alphas for the GSI were 0.94 at Time 1, 0.89 at Time 2, and 0.92 at Time 3. Seligson et al., 2003) The BMSLSS assesses satisfaction with life of children and adolescents in different life domains (friendships/ school/ family life / where I live/ myself as…). Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1="terrible" to 7= "delighted". Items are summed to yield a total life satisfaction score. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.082 at Time 1, 0.84 at Time 2, and 0.83 at Time 3.

Measures


The Brief Symptom Inventory


The Brief Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scale (BMSLSS;


The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C; Ebesutani et al., 2012)
The PANAS-C is a self-report questionnaire for children and adolescents that rate the levels of their positive and negative emotions during the previous month as indicators of their emotional well-being. The questionnaire includes five negative emotions (e.g., afraid, upset) and five positive emotions (e.g., enthusiastic, proud) that are rated on a 5point Likert scale ranging from 1="not at all or very slightly" to 5="extremely". Total scores for Positive and Negative Affect are summed. The alpha coefficients were 0.80-0.83 and 0.78-0.82 for the positive affect and negative affect scales respectively. (Mark & Janssen, 2008) The Screen Time Scale examines the daily duration of internet and television use, social media use, and video game play. Participants report the number of hours per day in the past month of media andscreen use (watching television/using the internet, playing video games, and using social media). Response categories range from 0 h to 7 or more hours per day. Television/internet, social media, and gaming time are summed to create an overall recreational screen time score. Moberg, 2003) The AADIS is a two-part scale that measures the history and the current use of licit and illicit substances. In the screening part, participants indicate their lifetime use of alcohol, cigarettes and drugs (e.g., "Have you ever tried smoking cigarettes?"). The second 12-item section on substance use behaviors was completed if participants reported any lifetime substance use (e.g., "have you ever tried marijuana or hashish -weed, grass?"). The items are rated on an 8-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (never used) to 7 (use several times a day).

Screen Time Scale


Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Involvement Scale (AADIS;
Current substance use was determined by the percentage of students who reported monthly, weekly, or daily use of each category of substances used during the previous twelve months (0 = no use, 1 = used). Due to negligible number of participants who reported using illicit drugs Note. Lesson numbers reflect their order in the PPAP intervention.
other than cannabis, only cannabis use data are presented in the current study. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.94 at Time 1, 0.95 at Time 2, and 0.93 at Time 3.

Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups were summarized and compared with a 2-sample independent t-test or χ 2 test, as appropriate. The changes in the outcome variables from preintervention to May 2022 were analyzed using mixed model growth curve analyses. The patterns of change over time were examined with a trend analysis that indicated that linear trend models were the best fit for the outcome variables.
The curve models were applied to the different outcome measures with the intercept and slope as parameters. For the substance use measures, binary outcomes were used. The intercept represented the level of each outcome at Time 1 (baseline) and the slope represented the changes in the outcome variables from Time 1 to Time 3. An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was specified.
Several demographic and school-and classroom-level indicators were considered as covariates, such as teacher effects, school size and school socioeconomic composition, but only those effects that weresignificant were retained in the final models. The level 1 models examined growth trajectories based on Time and captured within-subject changes over the different assessment points. The level 2 models examined how between-subject demographic variables accounted for the growth parameters in the Level 1 models. Gender (girl = 0, boy = 1) and condition (control = 0, intervention = 1) were entered with dummy coding, and age was centered on the average participants' age. Other demographic variables were not significant predictors. The level 3 models included the school level (primary school = 0, secondary school = 1) and the number of students in the classroom to determine the influence of the school and classroom contexts on the outcome variables.
In addition to the growth models, statistically significant mean differences within and between groups were assessed using t-tests and chisquare tests. Cohen's d was used to calculate effect sizes for differences. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to account for missing data, which amounted to less than 3 % across the study variables.
