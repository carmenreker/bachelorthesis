 The study focused on healthy women aged 60 and older who felt a discrepancy between their generative desire and generative achievement. A group of 78 participants was randomly assigned to a generativity writing intervention or a control group with neutral writing tasks. The intervention aimed to enhance participants' sense of generativity by having them write weekly about their life experiences and share their insights with a future audience. The control group wrote about mundane topics without the purpose of generativity. Both groups provided written consent, and the study was approved by the UCLA Human Subjects Protection Committee. The primary outcomes, including the recruitment process and the writing intervention details, are elaborated in the Moieni et al. (2020) report and supplementary materials. The final sample consisted of 73 women, with a slight majority in the control group. The study's design and primary outcomes were registered in a clinical trial registry. The intervention's impact on participants' perceptions of social support and feelings of loneliness were analyzed using the PROCESS macro, controlling for pre-intervention levels.
