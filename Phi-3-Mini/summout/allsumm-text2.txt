 The study was a controlled trial conducted in Zanjan's health centers, evaluating the impact of positive psychology counseling on coping strategies among pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Sixty out of 60 eligible women were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, receiving six sessions of positive psychology counseling, or the control group, which received routine care. The counseling aimed to improve coping mechanisms and was conducted individually, adhering to health protocols. The intervention group showed significant improvement in their coping strategies over time, as measured by a pregnancy adaptation questionnaire with high reliability. The control group received standard care without additional counseling. Data were normally distributed, and differences between groups were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA with a small to moderate effect size.
