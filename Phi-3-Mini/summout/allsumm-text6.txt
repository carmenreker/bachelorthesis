 The study employed the RE-AIM framework to evaluate a randomized controlled trial within the WIRUS project, focusing on the 'Reach' aspect of the process. A standardized questionnaire was distributed to all employees in 22 Norwegian companies, with 8,542 employees (27.7%) responding, of which 6,162 were identified as risky drinkers based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Out of these, 779 were contacted and invited to a health examination, where they could be randomized into an alcohol prevention intervention. The interventions included a face-to-face brief motivational interviewing session and information booklet, a digital eHealth program, or a control group with just the information booklet. Participants were employees aged 16-72, mostly male, with a university education, and who scored high on the AUDIT. Willingness to participate in the intervention was determined by positive responses to the OHS invitation, attendance at the health examination, and consent to randomization. Sociodemographic, alcohol-related, work-related, and lifestyle factors were analyzed to identify correlates of willingness to participate. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were used to examine significant predictors. The study adhered to ethical standards, ensuring voluntary participation and confidentiality, with informed consent obtained at each step.
