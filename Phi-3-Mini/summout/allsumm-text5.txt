 The study involved 267 participants who met specific inclusion criteria and completed all measurement points, with a majority being women from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. They were highly educated, with most holding university degrees. The study employed the Authentic Happiness Inventory and a newly developed scale to measure change beliefs about well-being. These scales showed high internal consistency. Participants were unaware of the study's conditions and could start the intervention at will, receiving automated feedback after completion. Data were analyzed from the final sample, which excluded those who did not follow the exercise regimen. The study used R for statistical analysis, focusing on the relationship between exercise completion and change beliefs about well-being.
