 The study employed an online intervention involving daily exercises over a week, with participants' completion and engagement, time investment, perceived benefit, and voluntary continuation of the exercise being measured. They completed validated self-report measures assessing well-being and change beliefs before and at multiple follow-ups. The final sample comprised 267 participants, predominantly women from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, with high education levels. Data were collected through a website, with participants unaware of the different conditions. Completion and engagement in the exercise were self-reported, and missing data were handled through multiple imputation. The final sample showed no significant differences between intervention and control groups on sex, age, education, or change beliefs. The study used logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization for data analysis, aiming to identify the minimal number of predictors for optimal classification. The final sample's demographics were mostly German-speaking, highly educated women, with no significant differences between those who completed the study and those who did not.
