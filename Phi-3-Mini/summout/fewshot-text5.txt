 The study involved 840 participants who registered online, with 267 individuals (31.8%) from the initial pool being included in the final sample based on specific criteria: age (â‰¥18), non-regular illegal drug use, no current psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic treatment, and completion of exercise and measurement time points. The final sample comprised mostly women (83%), predominantly from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, with a high level of education. The study employed the Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) and the Well-Being Change Beliefs Rating Scale to assess well-being and change beliefs. The AHI demonstrated high internal consistency, and the study's factor analysis resulted in two factors for change beliefs: general change beliefs and instrumental change beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions and completed various questionnaires assessing their well-being, change beliefs, and exercise-related experiences. Data analysis was conducted on participants who completed the exercise and time points, using R software.
