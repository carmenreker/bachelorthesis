This paper details the methodology of six studies assessing the impact of mindset interventions on stress appraisals and coping among adolescents from diverse backgrounds. Participants were randomized to receive either a synergistic mindsets intervention or control conditions via a web-based platform. The intervention focused on controllable stress and growth mindset, with data collected via electronic surveys and physiological measures. Intention-to-treat analyses were used to handle missing data, and various models were applied to analyze the treatment effects. The core mindset measures were manipulated pre-intervention, and the study's design and procedures aimed to minimize researcher degrees of freedom and ensure the feasibility of data collection. Data collection was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the interventions included both online components and in-person elements. The interventions' effectiveness was evaluated using Bayesian regression techniques.
