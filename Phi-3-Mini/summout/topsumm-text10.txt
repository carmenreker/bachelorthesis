 The study involved 56 infants (29 12-month-olds and 24 24-month-olds) and 21 24-month-old children (9 males) who were tested for their reactions to emotional expressions displayed by a peer towards toys. The participants were predominantly white and middle-class, with families from a medium-sized city and surrounding suburbs. All children completed the task, but data from one 12-month-old girl were excluded as she showed no interest in the toys.

In the experiment, infants were first acclimated with a short play period and then observed during a series of trials where they interacted with toys under the influence of a video displaying a peer's emotion. Positive or negative emotions were shown towards the toys, and the reactions of the infants were recorded. The first behavior measured was the duration of the infants' gaze towards the video, indicating their attention to the peer's emotions. The second behavior was the infants' touching of the toys, which was used to gauge their engagement.

The procedure involved infants seated in a high chair, with their mothers present but not interacting with them. The testing environment was set up with a video and toys within the child's reach, and the mother was instructed to remain non-interactive. The experimenter, positioned behind a curtain, managed the toys and the video display. The study utilized a coding system to measure the infants' behaviors, ensuring reliability through intercoder agreement.

The toys and the peer's emotional expressions were standardized across trials, with the peer's expressions alternating between neutral, positive, and negative. The duration of looking and touching behaviors were recorded, with the first behavior indicating attention and the second indicating engagement. The study's design aimed to ensure that the session ended positively and that the mother's behavior did not influence the infant's responses.
