This study was a randomized, parallel-group pilot and feasibility trial conducted in Detroit, Michigan, between May and December 2020, focusing on older adults aged 60 and above with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Participants were recruited through a registry and community locations, with eligibility determined by age, certain pain conditions, and activity limitations. The intervention, Positive STEPS, was adapted from a previous intervention for internet use and involved seven weeks of program materials delivered via phone, with culturally adapted content and activities approved by community health workers (CHWs). The control group received a single access to study materials without additional intervention. The Positive STEPS program included modules on pain management, goal setting, staying active, and engaging in positive activities, with CHW support over the phone. Participants used activity trackers and were assessed via telephone interviews on pain, functioning, self-efficacy, social participation, resilience, and demographic variables at baseline and 8 weeks post-intervention. The method section details the development and adaptation of the intervention, recruitment strategies, and the study's feasibility and acceptability measures, as well as data analysis techniques.
