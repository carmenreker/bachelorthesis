 The studies received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Rochester and the University of Texas at Austin, with informed consent or assent from participants. Researcher degrees of freedom were minimized through pre-registration and adherence to published protocols. The intervention, a single online session, aimed to alter mindsets about stress and intelligence, promoting growth and stress-as-enhancing mindsets. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition, with neither aware of the other's assignment. Adherence to the intervention was high across studies, and control group content was designed to be similar to the intervention without conveying the malleability of intelligence. Negative mindsets were measured at baseline, and manipulation checks post-intervention indicated a reduction in negative mindsets in the intervention group. The studies varied in sample size, participant demographics, and procedures, but all employed intention-to-treat analyses and standardized measures of mindsets, physiological responses, and self-reported outcomes. The interventions were analyzed using Bayesian causal forests to estimate treatment effects and understand moderators.
