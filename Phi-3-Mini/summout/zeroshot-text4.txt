 The study was a controlled randomized controlled trial conducted from October 2020 to May 2021 in Zanjan city, Iran, involving pregnant women with mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. Ten health centers were randomly selected, and eligible participants were identified through a national electronic identification system. Inclusion criteria were specific Rhodes' scores, gestational age, chronological age, literacy, and contact availability. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy complications and stressful events in the last three months.

The sample size was determined through a pilot study and calculated to be 30 participants per group, considering a 95% confidence level and 80% power. Participants were allocated to intervention and control groups using a randomized four-block method. The intervention group received six sessions of positive psychology counseling, while the control group received routine care.

Data were collected using the Rhodes' nausea and vomiting severity scale, demographic questionnaire, and pregnancy adjustment questionnaire. The study outcome assessed coping patterns before and after the intervention. The data analysis involved the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square tests, independent t-tests, and repeated measure ANOVA.
