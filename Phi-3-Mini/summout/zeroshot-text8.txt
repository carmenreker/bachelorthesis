 The study involved 267 participants who completed an online intervention and questionnaires, with the final sample meeting inclusion criteria such as age, non-drug use, and no ongoing psychotherapy or psychopharmacologic treatment. The majority were women, predominantly from Germany, with a high level of education. The Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) and the Well-Being Change Beliefs Rating Scale were used to assess well-being and change beliefs, respectively. The AHI showed high internal consistency, while the Well-Being Change Beliefs Rating Scale was validated through factor analysis, revealing two factors: general change beliefs and instrumental change beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to either the "three good things" or "early childhood memories" exercise condition and were asked to complete daily exercises for one week. Data were collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up sessions, with additional process questions assessing exercise completion, time investment, liking, perceived benefit, and ease. The study's main analyses focused on the final sample who completed the exercise and all measurement time points.
