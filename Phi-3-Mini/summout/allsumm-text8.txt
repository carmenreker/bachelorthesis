This paper describes the methodology of a pilot and feasibility study that aimed to evaluate a positive activity intervention, Positive STEPS, for chronic pain in older adults. The study was conducted in Detroit, Michigan, and included adults aged 60 and older with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Participants were recruited through a registry and community locations. The intervention, developed from a prior successful online intervention, was delivered remotely, with participants engaging in activities such as Savoring, Life Review, and Music as Medicine. The study was designed as a randomized control trial with a control group that received basic information, and both groups were assessed through telephone interviews at baseline and 8 weeks post-intervention. Feasibility was measured by retention rate, engagement, and participant feedback on the intervention's components. Primary outcomes included pain interference, physical functioning, and change in pain intensity. Secondary outcomes were social participation, resilience, and satisfaction with pain management. Data analysis involved comparing baseline characteristics, examining primary and secondary outcomes by group, and analyzing open-ended feedback. The intervention's effectiveness was evaluated using univariate analysis of variance models, with change in outcomes from baseline used as the dependent variable. The results of these analyses are not included in the summary.
