This study involved 1,670 students from six schools in Israel, investigating the impact of a Positive Psychology Addiction Prevention (PPAP) program on various psychological and behavioral measures. Participants, aged 10 to 16, were selected through a two-stage sampling process, excluding certain schools to maintain demographic consistency. The PPAP program, implemented over two school years and monitored for fidelity, integrated addiction prevention with positive psychology concepts and was delivered by trained teachers. Data were collected at three points: before the intervention, at its conclusion, and one year later, using tools like the BSI-18 for mental health symptoms, the BMSLSS for life satisfaction, PANAS-C for affect, and the AADIS for substance use. Analyses included comparing baseline characteristics, examining growth trajectories with mixed model curve analyses, and assessing mean differences and effect sizes. Missing data were handled using maximum likelihood estimation.
