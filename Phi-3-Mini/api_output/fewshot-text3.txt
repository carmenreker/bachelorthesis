This paper outlines the methodology of a study conducted in Zanjan, Iran, from October 2020 to May 2021, focusing on the effectiveness of positive psychology counseling for pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. After obtaining consent, 30 pregnant women were enrolled and randomized, with 15 in the intervention and 15 in the control group. The intervention, involving six individual counselling sessions, was designed to improve coping with pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting and included a follow-up period of four weeks. Measures included the Rhodes nausea and vomiting severity scale and a pregnancy adaptation questionnaire, assessing coping strategies. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16 with specific statistical tests, considering the intervention condition, baseline parent distress, and their interaction. No significant assumptions were made, and the results are not included in the summary.
