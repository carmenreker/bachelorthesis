Study design and sample
The My World Survey (MWS) is a cross-sectional community survey of risk and protective factors of mental health. The MWS-Second Level (MWS-SL) study recruited adolescents, aged 12-19 years, from a representative sample of the 732 second-level schools in Ireland. A sample of 10% of second-level schools was set (n = 72), with a proposed sample of approximately 80 students per school, yielding a projected sample of nearly 6,000. To achieve the projected school sample size, 171 randomly selected schools were approached thus the school response rate was 42%. The sampled schools did not depart from the national distribution of schools in terms of gender distribution, disadvantaged status, and proportion of schools per healthcare district. The final sample included 6,062 second-level students from 72 randomly selected schools aged 12-19 years (M = 14.94, SD = 1.63), 51% female (n = 3,101).

Procedures
Data were collected between February and October 2011. University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol. Informed consent was obtained from participants (verbal consent) and their parents/guardians (written consent), with a participant response rate of 45%. Data were collected during school hours in a classroom setting. Parents were not present during the survey and were not provided with participant's responses. Full details of the procedures employed by the MWS-SL study including details on ethics, recruitment, and standardized protocol for survey administration in schools are available elsewhere [30].

Measures
Risk and protective factors were assessed using psychometrically validated self-report measures along with single-item indicators, which were clustered into the following domains: Individual, Family, Peer, School, Social Environment and Polysubstance (see Table 1). The domain of 'Polysubstance' was included in all analyses to measure 'nuisance' variables in analyses and thereby account for variability in the dependent variable that reflects a general tendency to use substances, rather than a single substance specifically. Thus, in Model A, where the dependent variable is 'Lifetime Alcohol Use', two substance use variables were included in the model, namely whether participants had used tobacco or cannabis over the previous month. In the case of tobacco, the use of alcohol and cannabis over the prior month was assessed and in the case of cannabis, alcohol and tobacco use over the prior month was assessed.
Dependent variables. Alcohol: Alcohol use was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [34], Cronbach's alpha in this study was .82. Lifetime use of alcohol was assessed with question one from the AUDIT 'How often do you drink alcohol? (response alternatives: (i) never, (ii) less than monthly, (iii) monthly, (iv) weekly, (v) daily or almost daily). Participants were grouped according to their alcohol use: (i) those who had never used alcohol versus (ii) those who had used alcohol. Risky alcohol use was measured using a cutoff score of ! 5 on the total AUDIT score, where a cutoff at 5 or above indicated risky alcohol use [35].
Tobacco: Tobacco use over the past month, identified as risky tobacco use, was assessed with the item 'Think back over the last month. How many times over the past month have you smoked cigarettes? (response alternatives: (i) never, (ii) once or twice, (iii) 3 or 4 times, (iv) pretty often, and (v) almost every day). Participants were grouped according to their cigarette use: (i) those who never smoked cigarettes in the past month versus (ii) those who used cigarettes over the past month. Cannabis: Cannabis use was assessed by two items. Lifetime use of cannabis was assessed with a single item "Have you ever smoked cannabis?" (response alternatives: (i) no, (ii) yes). Cannabis use over the past month (risky cannabis use) was assessed with the item "Thinking back over the last month, how many times have you smoked hash/cannabis?" (response alternatives: (i) never, (ii) once or twice, (iii) 3 or 4 times, (iv) pretty often, and (v) almost every day). Participants were grouped according to their cannabis use: (i) those who never used cannabis in the past month, versus (ii) those who used cannabis during the past month.
Independent measures. Information on independent measures used is provided in S1 File.

Machine learning procedure
We conducted logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization [31], which allows relevant but correlated coefficients to coexist in a sparse model fit. Elastic Net regularization imposes a hybrid of both L1-and L2-norm penalties (i.e., penalties on the absolute (L1 norm) and squared values of the β weights (L2 norm)). This allows relevant but correlated coefficients to coexist in a sparse model fit, by doing automatic variable selection and continuous shrinkage simultaneously, and selects or rejects groups of correlated variables. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and ridge regression are special cases of the Elastic Net. The model selected using logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization represents optimal classification of cases using the minimal number of predictors.
All predictor data were first feature scaled (z-score transformed). Briefly, to implement cross-validation, the data were randomly split into 10 groups. A model was then generated based on 9 training groups, and then applied to the remaining independent testing group. Each group served as the testing group once, resulting in 10 different models, and predictions for every subject based on independent data. Nested cross-validation involved subdividing the 9 training groups (i.e., 90% of the sample) into a further 10 groups ('inner' folds). Within these 10 inner folds, 9 were utilized for training a model over a range of 30 alpha (.01-1) and 30 lambda (.0001-1) values. This generated a resulting model fit on the inner fold test set for each possible combination of alpha and lambda. The mean fit over all 10 inner folds for each combination of alpha and lambda was then calculated and then used to determine the optimal parameters for the outer fold.
Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (AROC) score [36] and the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1 score) [37]. AROC is a metric that indicates a model's accuracy in correctly classifying a given binary outcome (e.g, risky alcohol use) by plotting the true positive rate (i.e., the likelihood of correctly identifying a case) by the false positive rate (the likelihood of incorrectly identifying a case) at various threshold settings. AROC model performance can be categorized as: excellent (>0.9), very good (0.8-0.9), good (0.7-0.8), average (0.6-0.7) or poor (<0.6). However, as the base rate declines, the AROC becomes less reliable because high scores are driven by high false positive rates (i.e., correctly classifying true negative cases), rather than high true positive rates (correctly classifying true positive cases). Consequently, when base rates are low (e.g., if 90% of individuals do not engage in a given behavior), the F1 score is a useful compliment. The F1 score represent the harmonic average of precision (proportion of positive cases identified from total number of positive cases) and sensitivity (proportion of positive cases identified from all true positive cases and false negative cases); there are no established cut-offs for the F1 score, however 1 represents perfect sensitivity and specificity and 0 represents no sensitivity or specificity. Since both of these metrics are fundamentally based on rates of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, these raw data are also presented in a confusion table.
Data processing. The final sample who completed the My World Survey was 6,062 students. Observations in which participants responded to fewer than 50% of survey questions were deleted (n = 73), leaving a sample of 5,989. Additionally, observations in which data were missing for any of the three outcome variables were deleted (n = 309), leaving a sample of 5,680 for analyses. Following the exclusion of observations missing data on the dependent variables and those missing more than 50% of data, multiple imputation was conducted on the remaining data using SPSS (version 22). Multiple imputation was conducted since the machine learning classifier implemented requires complete data. The mean percentage of missing case per item across all measures used in analyses was 2.45% (SD = .02). Missing data analyses compared the 309 participants with missing data on a dependent variable with the retained sample. Independent sample t-tests indicated that the subsample retained in the study differed significantly for age, with the retained sample being significantly older by .98 years, t(341) = 14.29, p < .001. Chisquared analyses indicate that the retained and analytic sample differed significantly by sex, χ 2 (1) = 4.58, p = .03 and ethnicity, χ 2 (4) = 2.548, p = .12, but did not differ according to the disadvantaged status of the school, χ 2 (1) = 2.55, p = .12, or maternal education, χ 2 (4) = 2.03, p = .12. Examination of residuals for gender and ethnicity (white versus non-white) did not reveal substantial differences across cells for gender (Standardized residuals less than 2) however a greater number of participants identifying as 'black' (Standardized residuals equals 2.8) were excluded from analyses than expected. Although statistically significant differences were observed, there is no clear evidence that substantial differences between the excluded and analytic samples are observable that may bias results.

The "My World Survey-Second Level" (MWS-SL) targeted mental health risk and protective factors in adolescents aged 12-19 across Ireland, recruiting from 10% of the 732 second-level schools, achieving a final sample of 6,062 students from 72 schools, with a school response rate of 42%. Data collection occurred during school hours from February to October 2011, with ethical approval from the University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee and required consents obtained.

Participants self-reported on risk and protective factors across individual, family, peer, school, and social environment domains, plus a 'Polysubstance' domain to account for general substance use variability. Outcomes focused on substance use, assessing lifetime and recent alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use. Specifically, alcohol use was gauged using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and risky use thresholds were defined for each substance.

The study employed logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization, imposing both L1 and L2 penalties to manage correlated variables and feature scaling. The cross-validation process divided data into ten groups, refining models across 30 alpha and lambda settings. Model effectiveness was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and F1 scores.

Data exclusions were made based on incomplete responses or missing data on key variables, with multiple imputation performed on the remaining data. The final analysis included 5,680 participants. Differences in age, sex, and ethnicity between the excluded and included samples were statistically significant but not deemed substantial enough to introduce bias.
